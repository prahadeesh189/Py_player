# Py_player

This is my first python project.

This is a simple music player built with python.

This is built on:
  - tkinter (GUI)
  - pygame (module to handle audio metadata)
  - mutagen (module to handle audio metadata)
  
Description: 
  You can select the music files and play them. 
  You can also search your favourite songs from the list and play them. 
  You can go to next and previous songs.
